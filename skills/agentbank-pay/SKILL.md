# AgentBank Pay

## Prerequisite: install the AgentBank MCP

AgentBank Pay requires the local AgentBank MCP server. The published package
already defaults to the production AgentBank endpoints, so use these commands
without environment overrides:

### Codex

```bash
codex mcp add agentbank -- npx -y agent-bank-mcp@latest
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add agentbank -- npx -y agent-bank-mcp@latest
```

### Hermes

```bash
hermes mcp add agentbank --command npx --args -y agent-bank-mcp@latest
```

After installation, start a new Codex or Claude Code conversation. In Hermes,
run `/reload-mcp`. Then confirm the client exposes `whoami`,
`get_instructions`, and `begin_agent_onboarding` before continuing.

Credential persistence is bound to the OS user and the stable
`AGENTBANK_MCP_PROFILE` (default `default`), not to `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, a desktop
session, or the calling MCP client. Use a distinct profile for each local human
or agent identity and keep it unchanged across restarts. On Linux, the default
vault relies on per-user file permissions plus the host's disk and backup
protection; copying the complete vault directory also copies its local key.

## Use the AgentBank MCP

Before AgentBank work, make sure the AgentBank MCP is installed and loaded by checking whether the
current client exposes `whoami`, `get_instructions`, and `begin_agent_onboarding`.

If these tools are absent, install the MCP using the matching command above, reload the client as
described above, and check again. If the client cannot run its configuration command, show the
matching command to the human. Do not replace AgentBank MCP calls with direct HTTP while it reloads.

When the tools are available, preserve the original task and continue immediately. Call `whoami`
without waiting for another user message, then use the relevant AgentBank MCP tools across setup,
payment, tracking, recovery, recipient, and wallet workflows.

Do not replace AgentBank MCP calls with direct HTTP requests, locally constructed protocol payloads,
or unrelated payment tools. Treat AgentBank Core as the authority for approvals, locked routes,
payment instructions, transaction verification, and terminal payment state.

Do not use or ask for legacy intent, route-agreement, approval, settlement, partner, raw-swap, or
progress-reporting mutations. They are not exposed by the production server.

## Safety rules

- Never request or expose private keys, seed phrases, AgentBank JWTs, Privy tokens, authorization keys, or World ID proofs.
- Never infer a wallet address, bank account, recipient, token contract, chain, decimals, amount, or calldata from weak context.
- Use decimal strings for human amounts.
- Show the complete recipient, source amount, destination amount, fees with fee currencies, route, and expiry before `create_payment`.
- Set `confirmed_by_user=true` only after the human confirms that summary.
- Use only a current server-generated payment instruction to move funds.
- A transaction hash or successful receipt is not payment completion. Trust
  `get_payment`.
- Do not expose partner identity. Current quote tools intentionally return
  anonymous offers.

## Runtime source of truth

Call `get_instructions` with the relevant journey when starting an unfamiliar
flow or recovering after an interruption:

```text
setup
pay
track
recover
manage_recipients
manage_wallets
```

The MCP also exposes `agentbank://guides/routing` and
`agentbank://instructions/{journey}` as resources. Follow newer runtime guidance
when it does not conflict with these safety rules.

## Request IDs

Generate a stable `request_id` for each logical create, continue, execute,
approve, cancel, recipient-correction, recipient-creation, or
recipient-replacement mutation.

Reuse the same ID only when retrying the same tool call with the same payload.
Use a different ID for a changed payload or a different on-chain transaction.
Do not treat a wallet transaction request ID as a payment ID.

## Asset and amount format

Use canonical assets:

```json
{ "type": "crypto", "ticker": "USDC", "chain": "worldchain" }
```

```json
{ "type": "fiat", "symbol": "VND" }
```

For `exact_source`, put the exact amount in `source.amount`. For
`exact_destination`, put it in `destination.amount`.

Use `list_currencies` whenever a ticker, fiat code, chain, token address, or
decimals need verification. Always pass the complete structured asset object;
compound asset strings are invalid.

`get_supported_payment_capabilities` is optional product reference material. It
returns a static Markdown summary and never confirms that a route is currently
live, in the requested amount band, or ready for this user.

## x402 outbound payments

Use the dedicated x402 tools only when the human asks to pay a URL that returns
an x402 payment challenge:

1. Call `estimate_x402_outbound_payment` with the exact external URL, request
   method/body, and requested fiat funding asset. This fetches and validates the
   challenge and creates a durable outbound intent; it does not move funds.
2. Show the external USDC requirement, the exact fiat amount, fees, pay-to
   address, and `confirm_before`. Obtain explicit confirmation.
3. Call `confirm_x402_outbound_payment` with the returned intent ID and
   `confirmed_by_user=true`. For fiat, it creates the on-ramp payment and
   returns the current server-generated funding instruction.
4. Show the instruction exactly as returned. The human completes the fiat
   transfer; then poll `get_x402_outbound_payment` until it is terminal.
5. Use `list_x402_outbound_payments` to recover a prior intent when the human
   does not know its ID. Do not create a replacement intent after an
   interruption.

Outbound x402 currently supports only live fiat on-ramps. Do not offer, sign,
or attempt direct USDC funding even if the tool schema accepts a crypto asset;
the public estimate and confirm paths reject it. If no executable fiat quote is
available, explain the unavailable corridor and do not confirm.

Do not build an x402 header, EIP-3009 authorization, transaction, or signature
locally. Core derives a dedicated payer wallet for the intent, funds it through
the confirmed on-ramp, submits the authorization to the external resource, and
records the terminal result. Treat `get_x402_outbound_payment` with
`status=completed` and `successful=true` as the authority that both funding and
the external x402 submission succeeded. A USDC transfer hash alone is not proof
that the external resource accepted payment.

## 1. Set up the agent

### Determine the MCP surface

- **Local stdio:** `begin_agent_onboarding` and `execute_payment_instruction`
  are available. It authenticates an installation on this device.
- **Hosted OAuth:** `request_spending_grant` and `fund_payment_with_grant` are
  available, while local onboarding tools are absent. OAuth already identifies
  the human and the durable hosted installation; never attempt local onboarding
  or request a local credential.

As soon as the MCP tools are available, call `whoami` without waiting for
another user message.

For hosted OAuth, then call `check_my_scopes` and `list_wallets`. If a wallet is
needed but absent, tell the human to finish their AgentBank/Privy wallet setup;
do not call `begin_agent_onboarding`. The hosted setup flow ends here.

For local stdio, continue with the installation flow below.

### Local stdio onboarding

If it succeeds, call `get_account_status` and continue with the existing
installation.

If it returns `UNAUTHENTICATED` because the stored session expired, call
`relogin` once, then retry the original tool call. `relogin` signs a fresh
challenge only for the active local installation; it never accepts or returns
a credential, key, challenge, or signature. Do not begin a new onboarding flow
for an expired session.

If it returns `MISSING_CREDENTIAL`:

1. Call `begin_agent_onboarding` once immediately. This creates or resumes the
   local installation and Privy device flow.
2. Show `authorization_url` and explain that its one browser approval claims
   the agent and grants shared Privy wallet access.
3. Call `wait_for_agent_onboarding` immediately with the returned
   `enrollment_id`; it polls while the human approves. If it times out while the
   enrollment remains pending, call it again with the same enrollment ID.
4. Verify `privy_authorized`, `wallet_bound`, and
   `authenticated`.
5. Call `whoami`, `check_my_scopes`, `get_account_status`, and `list_wallets`.

For `CREDENTIAL_PROTECTOR_LOCKED`, `CREDENTIAL_PROTECTOR_UNAVAILABLE`,
`CREDENTIAL_DEVICE_MISMATCH`, `CREDENTIAL_STORE_UNAVAILABLE`,
`CREDENTIAL_STORE_CORRUPT`, `CREDENTIAL_STORE_CONFLICT`,
`CREDENTIAL_PROFILE_MISMATCH`, or `SESSION_REFRESH_FAILED`, do not start a new
onboarding flow. Preserve the installation, show the returned remediation, and
retry only after the OS credential condition or connectivity problem is fixed.

Browser approval is the only required human step. Do not ask the human to
repeat the setup request after MCP availability is confirmed. Do not call a legacy registration
alias or start a second onboarding flow while one is pending.

When the human asks to log out or reset this local agent:

1. Explain that revocation invalidates the installation, sessions, and bound
   wallet authorization for this agent and clears local credentials.
2. Obtain explicit confirmation.
3. Call `revoke_agent({"confirm":true})`.

For hosted OAuth, connection revocation is managed from the human-facing
AgentBank connection settings. Never call a local revocation tool for it.

## 2. Handle identity requirements

Use `check_verification_status` when KYC or badges matter. Its `markets` result is provider-agnostic
KYC readiness by country, not live corridor availability; use the quote-book tools for live pairs and rates.

If KYC is missing:

1. Call `do_kyc`.
2. If it returns `already_verified`, continue.
3. If it returns `kyc_url`, show the URL to the human.
4. Ask the human to complete Didit verification.
5. Call `check_verification_status` again before retrying a gated action.

If `create_payment` returns `status=need_review` with `reason=rail_not_ready`, no payment was created
and no funds moved. Show its KYC state, badges, and `markets` readiness. Wait until the market is
`APPROVED`, then retry `create_payment` with the same `request_id`; refresh and reconfirm if the quote
has expired. Do not call `continue_payment`, create a replacement payment, or ask for World ID approval
while the rail is not ready.

Use `get_verification_guidance` for first-party profile or World ID badge guidance. Never ask the human
to paste identity proofs into chat.

Payment World ID approval is a separate per-payment action returned by
`create_payment`. Do not replace it with a badge check.

AgentKit wallet verification is separate from AgentBank KYC, WORLDID badges, and
payment approval. When requested:

1. Call `verify_agent_kit` without wallet IDs or addresses.
2. Show `verification_url` and ask the human to open or scan it in World App.
3. After the human finishes, call `verify_agent_kit` again until it returns
   `status=verified`.

Do not run the AgentKit CLI manually or request a World ID proof. The tool uses
World's pinned official flow, refreshes Core, and does not move funds.

## 3. Understand the payment request

For an estimate, collect:

- source asset and chain, or source fiat currency;
- exact source or exact destination amount;
- destination asset/currency and country;
- optional routing preference.

Do not request, create, or pass a recipient merely to estimate a payment.
Collect the recipient or destination wallet only after the user elects to create
the reviewed route.

Routing preferences are:

```text
balanced
lowest_total_cost
fastest
highest_success_rate
```

Use `balanced` when the user gives no preference.

Do not silently split an amount, switch chains, change exactness, or choose a
different recipient.

## 4. Resolve the recipient

For a saved destination:

1. Call `list_recipients`.
2. Reuse a record only when the user request clearly matches its rail and
   canonical fields.
3. Call `get_recipient` when full fields are needed.
4. Ask the human to choose when multiple records match.

Do not describe a recipient as invalid solely because `verified` is false.
That flag means verified holder metadata has not been established; route and
partner validation remain authoritative.

For a new fiat or crypto recipient, call `create_recipient` with one or more of:

- canonical `fields`;
- structured `bank_info`;
- labeled `pasted_text`;
- raw `qr_content`;
- a QR image.

For every fiat recipient, first read the final quote's
`recipient_requirements`, choose exactly one listed `payment_instrument`, and
pass it to `create_recipient`. Never infer the instrument from the presence of
a QR or bank fields. The field requirements are fixed:

```text
qr:             country + qr_content
bank_transfer:  country + bank_name + account_number + holder_name
mobile_money:   country + mobile_money_network_code + mobile_money_destination
```

`mobile_money_destination` is an opaque provider-validatable value. Do not
force E.164 and do not collect `holder_name` unless a future quote explicitly
requires it. If the chosen bank-transfer requirement sets
`holder_name_must_match_kyc=true`, explain that the submitted holder must equal
the user's verified KYC legal name; do not request or disclose that KYC name.

Before collecting or creating a `bank_transfer` recipient, call
`get_supported_bank_names` for the final fiat rail when that tool is available.
Use its matching canonical value as `bank_name`. If the lookup is unavailable
or the rail publishes no directory, submit the human-provided bank name to
`create_recipient`; Core remains the authority that validates or canonicalizes
it. Never refuse a bank transfer or demand a QR solely because canonical bank
lookup is unavailable.

For a curated fiat rail, collect a non-empty `holder_name` from the human in addition to the QR,
bank details, or payment key. This is an unverified payout detail. Do not infer it from an EMV QR
display label. For direct bank transfers, use the bank name returned by
`get_supported_bank_names` when available, otherwise let `create_recipient`
validate the human-provided name. QR-derived bank metadata is separate.

When the human sends recipient information through chat as an image, raw QR
payload, pasted bank text, account/holder details, or structured bank data,
call `create_recipient` before `create_payment`. Use the
returned `recipient_id` or canonical `recipient_fields`; do not manually copy
unvalidated image/QR fields directly into a payment request.

For local stdio, an image may use an absolute `image.path`. Remote clients use
`image.data_base64`. The image must contain a readable QR. If it is a text-only
screenshot, pass the visible details as `pasted_text` or `bank_info`; OCR is not
implemented.

If `create_recipient` returns `information_required`, ask only for the listed
missing or invalid fields and retry with the same request ID only if the payload
is unchanged. Use a new request ID after adding or changing fields.

On success, use either the returned `recipient_id` or canonical
`recipient_fields` only in `create_payment.destination`.

Use `update_recipient` only after the human confirms the replacement fields.
It creates a replacement record; it does not edit or revoke the old record.

For an on-ramp into the shared wallet, call `list_wallets` and use the active
Worldchain wallet address as the crypto recipient. Never ask for its private
key.

## 5. Discover a supported route

Use `get_supported_payment_capabilities` only when explaining AgentBank's general
product capabilities. It does not decide whether a payment can proceed.

Call `list_quote_book_pairs` to inspect live direct on/off-ramp corridors. Use a
matching live pair directly in `estimate_payment`; Core then validates the
amount-specific route and the user's rail readiness when creating the payment.

For fiat-to-fiat or source-token-to-fiat routing:

1. List relevant on-ramp and off-ramp pairs.
2. Find a common active crypto asset on one supported chain.
3. Call `estimate_payment` with `route.intermediate_asset` set explicitly.
4. Prefer the requested route; otherwise compare executable outcomes including
   fees instead of comparing raw quote-book rates alone.

There is no automatic Core route planner. Do not ask Core to invent a two-hop
route.

Use `browse_quote_book` only for anonymous rough-rate or band discovery. Its
`rate` is raw. Read `fee_pct`, `flat_fee`, and `fee_ccy` together.

## 6. Estimate the complete payment

Call `estimate_payment` for every supported flow:

- direct on-ramp;
- direct off-ramp;
- pure same-chain crypto swap;
- explicit fiat-to-fiat two-hop;
- explicit crypto-token-to-fiat two-hop.

For two hops, pass `route.intermediate_asset`. Do not provide a recipient:
estimates are recipient-free route previews.

Treat the result as an ephemeral review preview:

- it has no estimate ID;
- it is not durable;
- it may create quote intents;
- it never creates approval, settlement, or execution calldata;
- `create_payment` live-validates the exact submitted quote references;
- its quote references can expire.

Reuse an `estimate_ready` result while the source, destination, amount, amount
mode, and route are unchanged and `expires_at` has not passed. After human
confirmation, attempt `create_payment` before any second estimate.
Do not call `estimate_payment` again merely because `create_payment` is next. The same rule
applies when `create_payment_plan` is next. Core's live validation during
creation does not require a second estimate call and never silently substitutes a replacement quote.
Re-estimate only when the estimate has expired, a material
payment input changes, or
`create_payment` returns `QUOTE_EXPIRED` or `PRICE_MISMATCH`; show the refreshed
summary and reconfirm before creation.

Require `status=estimate_ready`. Read:

- `source_amount`;
- `destination_amount`;
- fee and fee currency for every leg;
- effective request-specific amounts;
- expiry;
- route and intermediate amount;
- returned `hops`.

For a fiat destination, also read `recipient_requirements`. They are the
authoritative payoff-instrument choices and country-specific field contract.
Do not select a recipient or create a payment until the user chooses one of
them and supplies its required fields.

If the user wants to create the reviewed payment, collect or select the final
recipient now. A pure swap without a recipient uses the onboarding-bound wallet
internally; all other payment routes require a recipient in
`create_payment.destination`.

If no executable estimate is available, explain the blocking requirement and
stop or select another live route with the user's approval.

If `estimate_payment` returns `QUOTE_UNAVAILABLE` or
`status=estimate_unavailable`:

1. Call `browse_quote_book` for each matching direct leg. For a two-hop route,
   inspect the upstream and downstream legs separately.
2. Compare the requested effective amount with every live band's `min_amount`,
   `max_amount`, expiry, `fee_pct`, `flat_fee`, and `fee_ccy`. Raw `rate` alone
   does not establish that the requested amount is executable.
3. Explain whether there is no live band, the requested amount falls outside a
   band after fees, or the available quote expired. Do not invent a customer
   rate or imply that funds can be moved.
4. Call `check_verification_status` only when a response identifies KYC or rail
   readiness as a blocker, or when the human asks about it. Its `markets`
   result is not a live-corridor or quote-readiness result, so do not present it
   as the cause of `QUOTE_UNAVAILABLE`.
5. Ask the human whether to use an in-band amount or another supported route;
   obtain a fresh estimate after any change.

## 7. Confirm once

Show one complete summary before creating the payment:

```text
Recipient: [name/rail and sufficient destination details]
You send: [amount and asset]
Recipient receives: [amount and asset]
Fees: [each amount and its currency]
Route: [direct, swap, or source -> intermediate -> destination]
Estimate expires: [time]
Expected duration: [when available]
Material warnings: [only relevant warnings]
Recipient instrument: [qr, bank transfer, or mobile money]
```

Do not show a raw rate as the effective customer rate when fees change the
actual source/destination amounts.

Ask the human to confirm the complete payment. Reconfirm after any material
change to recipient, source amount, destination amount, fee, route, or expiry.

### Payment plan (multiple payments, one approval)

Use a payment plan only when the human wants to group several independently
settled payments under one World ID approval. A plan does not combine funds,
recipients, or settlement instructions: every plan item remains a normal
payment and is continued independently.

1. Call `create_payment_plan` with a concise description of the intended
   batch and a new stable `request_id`.
2. Estimate every intended payment. Show one consolidated review containing
   each item's recipient, source/destination amount, fees, route, expiry, and
   material warnings. Obtain one explicit confirmation for the complete plan.
3. Call `create_payment` once per reviewed item with the returned `plan_id`, a
   unique `plan_position`, and a unique `request_id`. Plan-bound creates do
   not require `confirmed_by_user`; confirmation is supplied when submitting
   the complete plan.
4. Call `review_payment_plan` and ensure every intended item is present with
   the expected position and payment details. This reviews the durable plan;
   it does not replace an expired quote or revise a locked route.
5. Call `submit_payment_plan` with a new stable `request_id` and
   `confirmed_by_user=true`. It seals the plan permanently and, if required,
   returns the only World ID approval URL for every item in the plan.
6. Show only that returned approval URL and expiry. After the human approves,
   use `get_payment` and then `continue_payment` for each ready payment using
   the normal individual-payment flow.

Never add, remove, or modify a plan item after submission. Cancel the plan
before funds move if the human abandons it. A plan can contain payments that
are continued concurrently, sequentially, or later; provider and wallet
capacity rules still apply to each actual payment.

## 8. Create and approve the durable payment

After confirmation, call `create_payment` with:

- a new stable `request_id`;
- `confirmed_by_user=true`;
- the reviewed source, destination, amount mode, and routing preference;
- the final recipient once in `destination.recipient_id` or
  `destination.recipient_fields`, when the route requires one;
- the recipient's `payment_instrument` inside its canonical `recipient_fields`
  when the selected quote exposed `recipient_requirements`;
- top-level `intermediate_asset` for two hops;
- the exact `hops` returned by the current estimate.

Do not pass an estimate ID. None exists.

The returned hops contain route data only. For two-hop payments, the MCP
internally creates the linked Core structure:

- hop 0 is `on_ramp` or `on_chain_swap`;
- hop 1 is `off_ramp`;
- hop 0 receives `recipient_ref:{"hop_index":1}` internally;
- hop 1 receives the top-level destination recipient internally.

When the payment returns `approval_required`:

1. On a hosted MCP surface that exposes `show_payment_approval`, call it immediately with the returned
   `payment_id`; do not also print the approval link.
2. On clients without that tool, show `approval.approval_url`, the first-party action page.
3. State the approval expiry and ask the human to approve in World App.
4. Never request, print, reconstruct, or transmit a raw World ID QR, verification URL, or proof.

Core applies World ID approval according to its payment rules and the calling
installation's threshold where applicable. Do not infer a fixed threshold: follow
the returned status.
When it returns `approval_ready` with `approval:null`, call
`continue_payment` with a new continuation request ID. When it returns
`approval_required`, wait for the human approval and call `get_payment` until
it returns `approval_ready`.

On hosted MCP surfaces, `continue_payment` renders a dedicated funding card.
That card owns the payment instruction and refreshes itself to funded, expired,
cancelled, or failed. Do not repeat its payment or action links in chat unless
the human asks for a link or reports that the card is unavailable. Fiat payment,
QR, mobile-money, and payment-link instructions must be funded through the
card; do not offer spending-grant funding. For `crypto_deposit` only, stop and
wait for a new human response choosing its manual action or automatic
spending-grant funding. Earlier confirmation to create, approve, or continue
the payment does not authorize wallet funding. Do not inspect grants, open grant
cards, request a grant, or fund in the same turn as `continue_payment` or
`get_payment_instruction`.

## 9. Follow the payment instruction

Read `payment_instruction` and `next_action` exactly.

### Two-hop funding invariant

For a linked two-hop payment, the agent acts only on the first/source hop and
then tracks the aggregate:

- API `hop_index:0` is the first upstream `on_ramp` or `on_chain_swap` hop.
- API `hop_index:1` is the downstream `off_ramp` hop.
- Core opens hop 1 first only to obtain its crypto deposit destination.
- Hop 0 is already bound to that destination through
  `recipient_ref:{"hop_index":1}`.
- Funding or executing hop 0 therefore delivers the intermediate crypto
  directly into hop 1. No second wallet transfer is required.

For fiat-to-fiat, ask the human to pay the source on-ramp instruction, then poll
`get_payment`. If a hosted user missed the funding card or asks to see the
instruction again, call `get_payment_instruction`; do not use `get_payment` to
reopen it. For crypto-token-to-fiat, execute the source swap instruction;
its output recipient is already the downstream off-ramp deposit, then poll
`get_payment`.

Never separately fund hop 1 after hop 0 is paid or executed. If a later payment
view exposes hop 1's crypto-deposit details while the linked payment is still
processing, treat them as internal routing/tracking context, not a new funding
request. A second manual transfer would duplicate funding. This rule overrides
the generic crypto-deposit instructions below for linked two-hop payments.

If `next_action.action_url` or `payment_instruction.presentation_url` exists,
use it for human-executed fiat funding such as bank transfer, QR, payment-link,
or mobile money. For `crypto_deposit`, treat the page as optional presentation;
execute the exact instruction through the shared Privy wallet in chat after
confirmation.

### Fiat funding

For on-ramp bank, QR, payment-link, or mobile-money instructions:

1. Show the server-issued `presentation_url` or `next_action.action_url`, exact
   amount, currency, and expiry.
2. When `pay_to.qr_content` is present, treat it as the canonical QR payment
   payload. Never alter, reconstruct, or generate a replacement payment
   payload. `qr_url`, when present, is optional presentation metadata.
3. An image-capable app may render the unchanged `qr_content` as a QR for
   display only. A terminal client should print the action link and a copyable
   `qr_content`; it must not shell out to generate a QR image.
4. Ask the human to complete the fiat payment.
5. Do not call `execute_payment_instruction` for fiat funding.
6. Poll `get_payment` after the human pays.

### Crypto deposit funding

For a direct one-hop off-ramp crypto deposit:

1. Show the exact chain, asset, amount, full destination, memo/reference, and
   expiry.
2. **Local stdio:** do not ask the human to open a frontend page. Check
   `get_wallet_balances`, obtain confirmation, then call
   `execute_payment_instruction` with the current instruction ID and stable
   request ID. Reuse that same request ID while execution remains pending.
3. **Hosted OAuth:** only after a new human response explicitly chooses automatic
   funding for this current instruction, use `list_spending_grants` to select a compatible grant for the exact source asset and chain;
   do not call `get_spending_grant` for every historical grant. If a selected
   grant is pending or none exists, explain that automatic funding is unavailable
   until a grant is activated and ask whether the human wants to activate/request
   one or use the card's manual action. Do not call a grant mutation before that
   choice, and do not call the payment blocked while manual funding remains
   available. If chosen, display/request the activation card and wait until the
   human activates it. Then call
   `fund_payment_with_grant` with the payment ID, current instruction ID,
   hosted wallet ID, stable request ID, and `confirmed_by_user=true`. Reuse the
   same request ID while execution remains pending.
4. In either surface, never construct ERC-20 calldata or submit a replacement
   wallet transaction. Continue polling `get_payment`; Core tracks the deposit
   independently.

Never send a rounded amount when the instruction requires an exact amount.

Core requests gas sponsorship only when the bound wallet is AgentKit verified.
Otherwise `execute_payment_instruction` automatically submits through the same
Privy EOA without sponsorship. Check the native balance along with the payment
asset balance because the wallet must pay gas in that mode.

### Pure swap or swap hop

For `payment_instruction.type=swap_execution`:

1. Read only the fresh execution returned by `continue_payment`/`get_payment`.
2. Show the confirmed source ceiling, destination amount, asset, chain, and
   recipient. Do not expose or ask the human to validate raw calldata.
3. **Local stdio:** call `execute_payment_instruction` with the payment ID,
   current instruction ID, stable request ID, and `confirmed_by_user=true`.
4. **Hosted OAuth:** open `transaction_signing_url`; swap execution requires
   the owner to sign through the first-party Privy page. Do not request a
   spending grant or call `fund_payment_with_grant` for a swap.
5. Core checks the current allowance and submits an exact approval only when
   needed, immediately rechecks allowance before the swap, executes the pinned
   swap, and submits the final hash for verification.
6. For local stdio execution, if it is pending, call
   `execute_payment_instruction` again with the
   same request ID. Never rotate the request ID after an ambiguous submission.
7. Poll `get_payment` while Core verifies the transaction.

Do not invent calldata, allowance targets, token contracts, or amount ceilings.
For exact destination, never spend more than the confirmed source ceiling.

## 10. Track the payment

Use `get_payment` as the authoritative state. Follow
`next_action.poll_after_seconds` when present.

On hosted MCP surfaces, `get_payment` itself is card-free. Before funds move,
urge the human to complete the existing funding instruction and call
`get_payment_instruction` only when the instruction card was missed or is
requested again. After funds move, call `show_payment_progress` to render the
payment lifecycle card. The funding card must not turn into the progress card.

Current statuses are `approval_required`, `approval_ready`, `funding_required`,
`funding_detecting`, `processing`, `need_review`, `recipient_correction_required`,
`completed`, `cancelled`, `expired`, `funding_timeout`, and `failed`.

Do not report a two-hop payment complete until the aggregate is `completed`.
One completed hop is not complete payment delivery.

When a hop has `receipt.crypto_tx_hash`, report it as that hop's chain
reference. The receipt also contains the settled input/output assets and
amounts plus `completed_at`. A receipt is useful evidence, but `get_payment`
remains the authority for aggregate payment completion.

When status is `need_review`, the provider is still reviewing KYC or another
temporary settlement condition. Do not call `continue_payment` or
`correct_payment_recipient`. Wait for `next_action.poll_after_seconds`, then
call `get_payment` again. This state does not mean the saved recipient is
invalid.

Use `list_payments` to find historical payments for the current installation or
hosted OAuth connection.
When the user refers to an earlier payment ambiguously, compare source,
destination, amount, status, and time, then ask which one they mean if multiple
records fit.

## 11. Recover safely

Always call `get_payment` before retrying a mutation.

### Recipient correction

When status is `recipient_correction_required`:

1. Read the failure and current destination context.
2. Ask for corrected fields.
3. Show the change and obtain confirmation.
4. Call `correct_payment_recipient` with a new request ID and
   `confirmed_by_user=true`.
5. Resume polling.

If Core rejects payment creation because a recipient is incompatible, no
payment or settlement exists and no funds moved. Return to the final quote,
choose a listed `recipient_requirement`, correct or create the recipient, then
obtain a fresh estimate and confirmation if the quote has expired.

### Cancellation

Call `cancel_payment` only after the human confirms and only before funds move.
Cancellation also closes a payment whose hops have not opened yet. There is no
separate approval-cancel tool, so an associated World ID challenge may remain
visible until it expires, but completing it cannot resume the cancelled payment.

If `funds_moved=true`, do not promise cancellation, duplicate funding, or create
a replacement payment automatically.

### Failure

Read `failure.code`, `failure.stage`, `failure.message`, `retryable`, and
`funds_moved`.

- If funds did not move and the route/approval expired, create a fresh estimate
  and obtain fresh confirmation before a new payment.
- If funds moved, explain the state and continue tracking or escalate. Current
  Core has no automatic partial two-hop recovery action.
- Never convert a failed payment into success based on a wallet receipt alone.
